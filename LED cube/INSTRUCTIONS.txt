INSTRUCTIONS:
1.	Connect all the negative leads of the 9 LEDs in a layer.
2.	Strand out the positive leads of all the LEDs
3.	Make 3 such layers
4.	Connect the corresponding positive leads of two consecutive layers
5.	Then do the same with the third layer.
6.	Mount the cube on the PCB and solder the 9 points of the 9 columns of the cube
7.	Solder a 1k ohm resistor to negative lead loop of each layer
8.	The 3 ends of the resistors soldered are the 3 outputs.
9.	Then take  9 pin header and solder to the PCB
10.	Solder 9 points of  the 9 columns to the 9 pin header.
11.	Connect all the 12 pins(3 from resistors and 9 from the 9 pin header) to the Arduino(you can use any versions of the Arduino available).
12.	Upload the code. 
13.	Done
